- Hi, I’m Alexandros Alexandrov. I'm an undergraduate student in the National and Kapodistrian University of Athens in the department of Informatics and Telecommunications.

- I’m interested in Web Development and Mobile Development and would like to work on one of the two in the future.

- May not be the best but if I'm truly interested I will try my best.
